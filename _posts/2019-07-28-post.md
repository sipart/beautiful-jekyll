* Consistency and the Democratization of work. From a ipspace mailshot:

'' A while ago Tom Limoncelli wrote a [great article](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3197520) about starting an automation journey from sysadmin perspective.

• Document what you’re doing. I usually add “try to simplify what you’re doing so you won’t be automating the existing mess”

• Create automation equivalents for your manual steps (I call this part “easy wins” or “picking the low-hanging fruit”)

• Create automation out of automated steps – at this point you should start thinking about data models, system architecture, and testing and deployment procedures

• Self-service portals – once you’ve automated the manual steps, integrate your tool with larger systems and give it a self-service portal. In networking world, you’d have to start thinking about IPAM/CMDB integration.

• Discipline – once you start the automation journey, never turn back. Even if you have to do one-offs automate them – because one-offs usually happen more than once. As expected, the main automation benefit Tom points out isn’t cost reduction or similar nonsense but:
• Consistency

• Democratization of work – an interesting way of saying “because you automated things, more people can work on the problem using your tools”

• Accelerating future work.

Even if you don’t care about automation I’d strongly recommend you read the [whole article](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3197520) ''
