| There are a number of Linux commands that can help you learn about other commands, the options they offer and where these commands are are located in the file system. Linux systems also provide a command that can help you to learn what commands are available related to some subject â€“ for example, commands that deal with user accounts. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                     |

| There are two commands that can help you find files on Linux, but they work very differently. One searches the file system while the other looks through a previously built database.                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                     |
