The power (or should that be value?) of the written word....

## Amazon AWS

* AWS re:Invent 2016: [Tuesday Night Live with James Hamilton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyOAjFNPAbA). Well worth a watch (all 1hr 33 mins!) – the first 35 mins is where all the network comment is. Especially impressive if you have in the back of your mind that Amazon started as an online book seller approx. 22 yrs ago…….now they have their own global network (8:18 in video), design and build their own network equipment (22:57) and have started to design and create ASICs (33:35). Also comment and rants about network vendor lock in (in section 22:57) and 10GbE/40GbE vs 25GbE optics (26:41).

## BGP is SDN's best friend!

## Juniper and JUNOS 
* Useful show commands [part 1](http://packetpushers.net/junos-useful-show-commands-to-capture-data-for-verification-and-troubleshooting-part-1/) and [part 2](http://packetpushers.net/junos-useful-show-commands-capture-data-verification-troubleshooting-part-2/)
* Overview of the new Juniper [QFX DC switch beast](https://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/release-independent/junos/topics/concept/qfx10016-hardware-overview.html#IdYHLSy5650iArt0.97?) 


## And finally….

* Fujitsu SaaS moves to Europe (been a thing in Fujitsu Japan for a while) – no not that SaaS but ‘Salad As A Service’, ripe for reading, innovation from the ground up and ready for [consumption (gulp)](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/11/28/fujitsu_salad_as_a_service_in_finland/)
