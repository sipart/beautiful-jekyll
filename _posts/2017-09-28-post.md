Now where is that idiots guide I bought in 1999?

## Linux

* Nice set of [David Bombal](https://www.youtube.com/user/ConfigTerm/) videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmfrXta5iRNrIjMcZHllB2ytVGyuKJOnb) titled "Linux for Network Engineers: You need to learn Linux!" 5 videos at approx. 5 mins each
* A vim [tutorial and primer](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/)
* Route-based IPsec VPN on [Linux with StrongSwan](https://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2017-route-based-vpn). This includes a comparative section with a Juniper vSRX example
* Deprecated Linux networking commands and their [replacements](https://dougvitale.wordpress.com/2011/12/21/deprecated-linux-networking-commands-and-their-replacements/)

## Docker & Containers

* Troubleshooting your Docker Swarm container network with [Host Pack](https://cumulusnetworks.com/blog/troubleshooting-docker-swarm-netq/)

## Labs

* Introducing [Cumulus in the Cloud](https://cumulusnetworks.com/blog/cumulus-in-the-cloud/) a great way to try and drive a Cumulus DC spine and leaf with NetQ setup with no real effort or try it out the harder way by using the Cumulus github page, EVE-NG and my post [here](https://sipart.github.io/2017-09-12-cvxnetq/) :-)
