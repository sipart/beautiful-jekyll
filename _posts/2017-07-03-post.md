Get started labbing with ease. 

## Labs

* [EVE-NG](http://www.eve-ng.net) - mentioned previously but recently updated and better than ever
* EVE-NG – [supported images](http://www.eve-ng.net/index.php/documentation/supported-images)
* EVE-NG – [How To](http://www.eve-ng.net/index.php/documentation/howto-s-2)
* GNS3 – just updated to [version 2](https://www.gns3.com/discussions/gns3-2-0-released) - installing the VM is the best way to get up and running with GNS3 apparantly – personally prefer EVE-NG

 
## SD-WAN

* Cisco [buys Viptela](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/01/cisco-scoops-up-yet-another-cloud-company-acquiring-sd-wan-startup-viptela-for-610-m/) so it now has IWAN, Meraki and Viptela – so lots of bases covered
* Juniper Cloud CPE and Contrail synergy. [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/5VcwPla_9uQ)
* Juniper [SD-WAN roadmap PDF](https://files.acrobat.com/a/preview/ebff5afe-5b9b-48b9-8b67-88ef74efce05)

 
## Juniper and JUNOS

* ipsec on MX test case (using a multiservice modular interface card) [PDF](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/release-independent/solutions/information-products/pathway-pages/ipsec-ms-mic.pdf)
* Build a Service Provider network on [one Juniper device](http://forums.juniper.net/t5/Routing/How-To-Build-a-service-provider-network-with-a-single-Juniper/ta-p/305637)
* Python [on-box scripting](http://forums.juniper.net/t5/Automation/FAQ-Learning-About-JET-Part-1-Python-on-Junos-OS/ta-p/297659)
* Using RIB Groups for Route Sharing in the Junos OS - [PDF poster](http://www.juniper.net/assets/us/en/local/pdf/books/day-one-poster-rib-groups.pdf)
* Self-Driving [MPLS Rings](http://forums.juniper.net/t5/TheRoutingChurn/Self-Driving-MPLS-Rings/ba-p/305309)
* EVPN MX setup - [rickmuir.com blog post](http://rickmur.com/evpn-configuration/)


## Automation and orchestration

* Top level github for Juniper automation [examples of all sorts](https://github.com/Juniper/junosautomation?files=1)
* OpenConfig demo - [ksator github page](https://github.com/ksator/openconfig-demo-with-juniper-devices/blob/master/README.md)
* Ansible network [Q&A webinar](https://www.ansible.com/webinars-training/ask-an-expert-networking-mar-2017)
* What is [OpenStack?](https://blog.rackspace.com/what-is-openstack-the-basics-part-1)

 
## Training

* Udemy has a sale at the moment (apparently it regularly does this) – content can be a bit variable apparently so read the comments and ratings – I just bought this for £10 - [Cumulus Linux and Ansbile fundementals](https://www.udemy.com/cumulus-linux-fundamentals-plus-ansible-automation/learn/v4/content)
