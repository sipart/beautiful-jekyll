## Intel hardware ticking time bomb

* Intel Atom C2000 System on Chip (SoC) issues (for our reference this SoC is used in some Cisco and Meraki products) – basically when the part fails the device is bricked and cannot be recovered. [Overview](https://networkingnerd.net/2017/02/09/intels-ticking-atom-bomb/). [Cisco support page](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/clock-signal.html). Cisco [affected products](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/clock-signal.html#~field). Cisco/Meraki will replace products but it’s up to customers to pick up the swap out costs.
