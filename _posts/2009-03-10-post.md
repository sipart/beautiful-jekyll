> 1) enter the shell with 'start shell'
>
> 2) pick your log file in /var/log (such as /var/log/authorization)
>
> 3) tail -f that sucker: "tail -f /var/log/authorization"
>
> 4) watch in real time/horror as the log whizzes by! https://t.co/Es8jaFxHF0

> This is like ``"show log authorization | refresh"`` except it only updates when the log file is actually written to

Junos tip of the day(tm):
follow a log file from shell!

1) enter the shell with 'start shell'
2) pick your log file in /var/log (such as /var/log/authorization)
3) tail -f that sucker: "tail -f /var/log/authorization"
4) watch in real time/horror as the log whizzes by! https://t.co/Es8jaFxHF0

As someone who has recently had to clean up the mess left by a network team who "learned Python" at a major service provider - step away from the switches for a moment.

Automation in networking is generally about getting your view of the truth and putting it into devices. The "putting it into devices" side of things has been done - there are a myriad different ways, some better than others, but they're out there, they exist, Cisco and Juniper and every man and their dog will give you a "drive our box from Python" mechanism (or two).

Step back a bit. What are you trying to achieve? What information do you need to achieve that? Where does that live? How do you transform that information into your desired config? How do you get that information?

You need to know how to write Python first. Start with the basics. Work with some web stuff, APIs, libraries like requests, parsing JSON, that sort of thing. Make a web page that lets you store a todo list in a database, render JSON out, and write a client for it that uses that API. You'll start to get your head around data structures and algorithms, which is what you *really* need to understand if you want to competently use any language, Python or otherwise, to help you do networking. Learn the ecosystem, too - learn git, bash (or your sh of choice), and understand how your code is actually executing on a box.

Once you've got a feel for it, then start to apply it. That todo list app? Now make that talk to a switch and list the interfaces. Neat! Now do neighbour discovery. But don't just make a big list of neighbours - build a graph of your physical network with the networkx library, and visualise it (maybe with another tool like Gephi, or as a web interface). Does that take a while to load your page? Maybe you need to add a database, and write something to run in the background and keep it up to date. Did you use the CLI to write the first version of your switch interaction? Cool. Now write it again with NETCONF/YANG, if your devices support it. Use your graph to do some analysis - where are your single points of failure? Bring in port stats; where are the most congested bits of your network?

Hopefully you'll at that point have a good understanding of Python and start to understand some of the fundamentals underneath it. There's a huge community of enthusiastic network engineers who "use Python" to do things that you could as easily do with Excel or find-replace in a decent text editor. I've seen very competent network engineers write Python scripts that did hundreds of lines of find-and-replace to rewrite XML from JunOS into something that looked like CLI output so they could run ping from a web interface and get something that looked identical to the CLI; if they'd understood the fundamentals better they could have at least used an XML parser and replaced hundreds of lines (that took them days to write) with a few lines that would work better. There are others in this thread describing their "tools" that spit out config based on some input variables; that they have humans in the loop for this operation should be seen as failure, at the very least of imagination. That Python let them make a tool that spits out config is to be celebrated no more than someone finding how to do mail merge in Word - because that is all you're doing, really. Someone's still sat there copy-pasting code to devices. No centralisation of truth has occurred. No authority of information has been established. People can still make typos and fixing it still involves logging into a box and working out what went wrong.

The real value in all this, though, is unlocked when you can *write automation **systems***, and that requires a deeper understanding. Fire up a tool like Netbox and describe your desired network in it; then try and apply that to your test boxes or VMs, by calling on Netbox's APIs in a Python script and translating that to configuration in either YANG models for NETCONF or CLI commands. You'll find it incredibly hard to do bordering on impossible (and create so many new problems for yourself) if you've spent your whole life writing Python to script CLIs. If you've done a bit more general Python you've got a much better fighting chance. If you're really smart you'll realise that other people have done bits of this and start to pick up third-party tools to help you, rather than reinventing the wheel like our XML-parsing engineer earlier.

And suddenly you'll find the real value in automation, when you can add a device to Netbox with its serial number, describe the physical and logical configuration there, plug it into the network and have it automatically spring to life as defined. Need to add a VLAN? Just configure it centrally and watch it roll out with no intervention. The authoritative source of your network config is no longer defined by `show interfaces` but by your inventory system.

There are a thousand other use cases, different protocols or domains to work with to achieve similar things, or to build reactive networks that act on change (seen a new MAC on the network? Maybe you want to add that to a SIEM database. That could be done via a Python script on a box...). That's where the value in "learning Python for networking"; the rest is just vendor hype.
