Tools You can Trust

## Automation and orchestration

* Juniper / DYN Infrastructure as Code with Ansible. 55 mins long but just watch from 17:45 till 22:30 to see a great example of DYNs solution which includes use of Netconf, GitHub, Ansible and Jenkins to create, dry run, create diffs, approvals and final push of the change by a human (including NOC notification).

* Ansible [webinars](https://www.ansible.com/webinars-training)
* The Business Benefits of [Automation and Orchestration PDF](http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/cloud-systems-management/network-services-orchestrator/white-paper-c11-738289.pdf)

 
## VPNs

* Podcast discussing DMVPN using certificates. Dynamic multipoint VPNs are Cisco proprietary but the main meat of the podcast touches on all aspects and concepts of certificate based VPNs so that’s the ‘interesting’ bit. [PacketPushers podcast](http://packetpushers.net/podcast/podcasts/pq-show-104-design-build-12-certificate-based-dmvpn-design/)
* Documentation on Junipers version of [DMVPN](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/security-auto-discovery-vpn-understanding.html)


## MPLS

* Test case detailing the use of route policies to place VPN traffic onto specific LSPs [Juniper PDF](http://juni.pr/2lF1Kz8)


## Virtual lab

* UNL or EVE-NG (alpha) as its now called is an all in one Ubuntu based VM that can run all manner of virtual network devices and machines (using QEMU, Dynamips, IOL/IOU) . Once you have it running and some images loaded it is all web browser driven. The web interface (if running in HTML5 mode) has telnet, VNC and RDP integrated. The VM works fine in the free VMware player and properly crafted labs look like Visio diagrams that are live labs.
