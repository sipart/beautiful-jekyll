## Getting started with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)

The below was completed on a bare metal server install of [EVE-NG](http://www.eve-ng.net/). 

EVE-NG is built upon Ubuntu 16.04 so all the below is pretty standard Linux/Ansible configuration.

By completing the below you are in effect creating an Ansible control node. Ansible then communicates with devices over SSH (no agent is needed on the managed devices). Below we are also setting netconf on Juniper devices to leverage the native device API.

As you can imagine Ansible (which is a product of [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible)) has extensive documentation and it can be found [here](http://docs.ansible.com/) - when getting more serious about Ansible then getting your file structure correct and ready for scaling up will reap dividends - check out this [Best Practice guide](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_best_practices.html).

[Ansible Tower](https://www.ansible.com/tower) and now [Ansible Engine](https://www.ansible.com/ansible-engine) exists where an organisation would like to pay for a supported GUI based controller for many playbooks and users.

Ansible have just (on the 7th Sept' 2017) [open sourced](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/ansible-open-sources-ansible-tower-awx) an upstream version of Ansible Tower and [it's here and it's called AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx). AWX is a great way for you to try Tower or for an organisation to maintain the code and support it themselves.

An alternative open source GUI controller also exists called [Semaphore](https://github.com/ansible-semaphore/semaphore). 

## Install steps, dependencies and notes.

Your server will need access to the Internet or locally mirrored repositories to complete all these steps with ease!

Create the Ansible user (you can use any username) while logged in as root and give them sudo access:

	adduser ansible

	usermod -aG sudo ansible

Login in as the user ansible and test; test by listing files in root:
	
	sudo ls -la /root

Create an SSH key (no passphrase) to access devices using an SSH key - this avoids having credentials in playbooks or stored on the Ansible server:

	ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048

Do initial updates and upgrades and then all the dependency installs:
	
	sudo apt update

	sudo apt upgrade

	sudo apt install software-properties-common

	sudo apt install -y ansible python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev software-properties-common python-setuptools build-essential

pip is the python installer management app:

	sudo easy_install pip

	sudo pip install ansible junos-eznc junos-netconify

	sudo ansible-galaxy install Juniper.junos

This useful utility allows the SSH key created earlier to be installed on managed devices; see [here](https://github.com/networkop/ssh-copy-net) for usage:

	sudo pip install git+https://github.com/networkop/ssh-copy-net.git


You can also add other ansible-galaxy modules - example Cumulus Linux:
	
	sudo ansible-galaxy install cumulus.CumulusLinux


Edit Ansible hosts file to work with devices:

	sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts

Example Ansible hosts file (setup Linux hosts file for name resolution or use IP addresses in the Ansible hosts file) - quite often referred to as the inventory. Note the use of different groupings - you can create as many of these as you like so you can target a device or group of devices as desired:
~~~
[MX]
vmx1 ansible_connection=local
vmx2 ansible_connection=local
vmx3 ansible_connection=local
vmx4 ansible_connection=local
vmx5 ansible_connection=local
vmx6 ansible_connection=local
vmx7 ansible_connection=local

[SRX]
oak01-r1 ansible_connection=local
ash01-r1 ansible_connection=local
oak02-r1 ansible_connection=local
ash02-r1 ansible_connection=local

[JUNIPER:children]
MX
SRX

[JUNIPER:vars]
juniper_user=ansible
juniper_port=830
~~~

As mentioned at the top SSH is used to communicate with a device so a user account on the device called ansible is needed with the SSH key and for Juniper devices we will utilise the netconf API to push and pull from the Juniper devices so that also needs configuring; Juniper example config below:

	set system login user ansible uid 2001
	set system login user ansible class super-user
	set system login user ansible authentication ssh-rsa "ssh-rsa blahblahblah ansible"

	set system services ssh
	set system services netconf ssh

Check the netconf connection:

	ssh -s ansible@vmx2 netconf
	
Some examples of ansible-playbook command line switches that use the ansible hosts file to target or limit devices or queries:

	ansible-playbook get.yml -l JUNIPER -t get-config-system
	
	ansible-playbook get.yml --limit=MX --tags=check-netconf

An example of a raw ad-hoc (single Ansible command line string - no playbook) test to a Cumulus VX:

~~~
ansible@eve-ng:/etc/ansible/work$ ansible spine01 -u cumulus --ask-pass -m "raw" -a "net show ver"

SSH password:

spine01 | SUCCESS | rc=0 >>
NCLU_VERSION=1.0
DISTRIB_ID="Cumulus Linux"
DISTRIB_RELEASE=3.3.1
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Cumulus Linux 3.3.1"

Shared connection to spine01 closed.
~~~

An Ansible [expert and colleague](https://github.com/mohclips) pointed out the following if you come across issues with writing to a device via a raw command or in a playbook, this will give you sudo/root equivalent when running actions against the device (as opposed to just logging into the device):

	-b, --become        		run operations with become (does not imply password prompting)
	-K, --ask-become-pass           ask for privilege escalation password

Another mention of the above issue and fix in a [Cumulus forum post](https://getsatisfaction.cumulusnetworks.com/cumulus/topics/ansible-not-able-to-overwrite-the-file).

The get.yml file content is provided below for reference as it's mentioned above in the Check Connection section:

    wait_for: host="{{ inventory_hostname }}" port="{{ juniper_port }}"
