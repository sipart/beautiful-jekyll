Cloudify

## Tools

* Dynamic mapping - probably been around for a while and other tools available but looked impressive [netbraintech](http://info.netbraintech.com/dynamic-map-private-demo-twitter4.html?)
* A rare bit of Cisco from me – nothing new but on a cheap and easy to setup device – one to keep handy in your toolkit – no reason why it can’t be adapted for other vendors [RPI Cisco configurator](http://packetpushers.net/raspberry-pi-cisco-configuration-device/)


## Cloud

* Closer look at [Google Cloud](http://markoinsights.com/2016/11/11/google-cloud-update/)
* Juniper [vMX and vSRX in AWS](https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/junipers-virtual-gear-gets-foothold-aws/2016/11/)
* More on [the above](https://forums.juniper.net/t5/The-New-Network/The-World-Deserves-the-Ability-to-Create-Hybrid-Clouds-Securely/ba-p/297607?)
