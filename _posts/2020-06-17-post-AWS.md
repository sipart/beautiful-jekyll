A reformatted email from an AWS trainer after a Cloud Practitioner Bootcamp. Lots of useful links to the slides and further reading and resources - all links working when published on 17th June 2020.

Thank you for attending the AWS Cloud Practitioner Bootcamp course - [slides PDF](https://cloud-practitioner-essentials.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Cloud-Practitioner-Essentials.pdf){:target="_blank"}. And congratulations for making it through. It was a lot of information at once. If you want to see some repetition about what I said just watch the [AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials Second Edition](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/LmsSsoRedirect?RelayState=%2flearningobject%2fcurriculum%3fid%3d27076){:target="_blank"} digital version. Additionally, under the [AWS Technical Professional Learning Path](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/training/path-tech-pro/){:target="_blank"} page, you can see links to AWS Business/Technical Professional and Cloud Economics digital content, which are all recommended for consumption. Finally, check the [AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam Guide PDF](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/Docs%20-%20Cloud%20Practitioner/AWS_Certified_Cloud_Practitioner_Exam_Guide_EN_v.1.7.pdf){:target="_blank"} and the sample [questions PDF](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/Docs%20-%20Cloud%20Practitioner/AWS%20Certified%20Cloud%20Practioner_Sample%20Questions_v1.1_FINAL.PDF){:target="_blank"} if you are looking to sit the Cloud Practitioner Certification Exam.
