Hi. My name is Simon Partridge. An ex wood machinist, was an aspiring product designer but now a self-taught IT professional; my path in IT started in 1997:

- Now a service provider network engineer
- Happy family man with a love of the Derbyshire Peak district

Technology, family and the great outdoors!
What else do you need in your life?
