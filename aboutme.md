Hi. My name is Simon Partridge. An ex wood machinist, was an aspiring product designer but now a IT professional; my path in IT started in 1997:

- Currently a [Juniper](http://www.juniper.net/uk/en/) Certified Service Provider Network Engineer
- Happy family man with a love of the [Derbyshire Peak district](https://www.visitpeakdistrict.com/)

Technology, family and the great outdoors!
What else do you need in your life?
